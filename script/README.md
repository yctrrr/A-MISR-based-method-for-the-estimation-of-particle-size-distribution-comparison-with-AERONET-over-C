**AOD_to_VSD:** Main function to calculate volume size distribution from MISR<br>

**01:** Analysis the raw dataset, including spatial distribution of AERONET and aerosol properties of AOD components<br>

**02:** Match AERONET with MISR AOD at daily, monthly, seasonal and annual levels<br>

**03:** Calculate MISR VSD and compare them with AERONET by scatter plots<br>

**04:** Estimate MISR V0.35 and V0.7 in China for 2004-2016 and visualize the spatial distribution<br>

**05:** Summarize the predicted results<br>
